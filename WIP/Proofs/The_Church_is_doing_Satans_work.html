    Plan of salvation relies on people having free agency and using that agency to choose God. This is made clear by God's decisino to choose Jesus's plan over Satan's plan.

    There a multiple definitions of evil, but two that are generally accepted are: evil is going 
    Rightous can be defined as "doing God's work". Then evil can be defined as "working against God" or, as the Devil and God are opposites, this could also be stated as "doing the Devil's work."
    Satan's plan was to save everyone. There are different theories as to how he might have done this: depriving people of thier agency, or perhapse saving everyone regardless of their choices. These methods have the same result: people are not allowed to choose God or their decision is disregarded.
    By endevoring to coerce people into the chruch, the church is carrying out Satan's plan by diminishing people's ability to choose God. People are being baptized who may not have if they had known the truth, and even those would have joined have no opportunity to make that choice - their agency is reduced as well.
    This is working against God's plan and doing Satan's work - meeting both our criteria for the definaition of evil.
    As long as the church continues this campain of disinformation and manipulation, they are endorcing and performing evil.
    
    Now, there is an argument to be made that perhapse these are not important details and that this simplified version of church history allows people to spend less time and brain power in reaching their decision. This argument eventually recduces down to "God restored his church in a really complicated way and should really have done it better."
